# **MP2_DFN** 
A motor controller board based on the NVMTSC4D3N15MC with a DFN footprint. 

This board is a variant from badgineer's Multi-Platform, Modular, Powerful Electronic Speed Control [MP2-ESC](https://github.com/badgineer/MP2-ESC). The project hosted here absolutely would not have been possible without the intellectual work of the MP2-ESC, and the team that contributed to development of that ESC. 

It should also be noted that in comparison to the MP2-ESC, this ESC is larger, more expensive, and completely untested. However, it is expected to still run with the [STM32F405 pill](https://github.com/davidmolony/F405_pill), and is fully compatible with David Molony's [MESC Firmware](https://github.com/davidmolony/MESC_Firmware).
